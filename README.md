# Ben's Markdown Editor v 1.0.2

Markdown Editor is a simple text editor to create markdown files for GitHub 
that I made in Lazarus when deploying read me files with your applications. The program features 
simple way to create the files such as adding headers, font styles, premade 
templates, inserting images, hyperlinks and even tables and much more.
